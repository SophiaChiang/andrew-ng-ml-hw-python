# andrew-ng-ml-hw-python
A collection of Jupyter Notebooks where I solve the homeworks for [Andrew Ng's wonderful, amazing, miraculous Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/1) but I do it in Python with Sci-kit learn rather than in MATLAB (open source FTW). This means I start from the data set provided for the homework and then I make the same plots, fit the same classes of algorithms and basically meet all the objectives of the homework. 

## Listing of Notebooks
The file [machine-learning-course-notebook](machine-learning-course-notebook.ipynb) includes all my notes that I took while watching the lecture videos (along with screen-capping what I considered the most useful slides from his powerpoints).

The homework notebooks are as follows:

[hw-wk2](hw-wk2.ipynb) - Linear Regression 
[hw-wk3](hw-wk3.ipynb) - Logistic Regression
[hw-wk4](hw-wk4.ipynb) - Neural Networks
[hw-wk6](hw-wk6.ipynb) - Bias-Variance, Learning Curves, Validation Curves
[hw-wk7](hw-wk7-spam.ipynb) - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
[hw-wk7-spam-preprocessing](hw-wk7-spam-preprocessing.ipynb) and [hw-wk7-spam-svm](hw-wk7-spam-svm.ipynb) - Spam Classification with NLP and SVM
[hw-wk8](hw-wk8.ipynb) - K-Means Clustering and Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
[hw-wk9-anomaly](hw-wk9-anomaly.ipynb) - Anomaly Detection
[hw-wk9-recommender](hw-wk9-recommender.ipynb) - Recommender Systems
